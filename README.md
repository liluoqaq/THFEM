# TFTEM - Official Implementation

## 1. Environment
Please note that our preprocessing and training code should be executed locally, and requires the following environmental configuration:

conda/mamba env create -f environment.yml

Note: We recommend using mamba to install dependencies, which is faster than conda.

## 2. Download Pretrained Models



## 3. Prepare Dataset

Download the [MEAD](https://wywu.github.io/projects/MEAD/MEAD.html) dataset.
